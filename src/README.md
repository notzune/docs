All information provided in this document is aimed at giving new and existing members of the development team some insight into what the AirshipCraft: Reborn (AC:R) project hopes to achieve. This document will describe every important element of the server, including its history, community, target audience, and previous issues that we have encountered in previous iterations. More importantly, the document will include suggestions as to how we can fix those issues, planned features, mechanics, and gameplay design. 

This is a living document. All content regarding mechanics and gameplay is subject to change as the project progresses. New features will constantly be implemented and documented as they are developed.   

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see a list of features added/removed and/or updated.  

This project utilizes [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for its versioning structure. The correct project version number should be displayed at the top of this page as well as at the top of the changelog.
   
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** at the time of writing, the project is currently in major version 0, meaning there is no playable nor stable version as the project is still in its initial development stage. 
   
## A Brief History

This is the second iteration of AirshipCraft. The first iteration was produced by mjcrafter100 (now Grau_Wulf)'s original AirshipCraft in 2015. The vision for his server was little more than an SMP server inspired by Movecraft and Factions features, nothing else. Although simple, it was extremely popular and loved by many. As AirshipCraft evolved, the vision shifted to form a geopolitical server which would later be known as 'Total War'. The Total War series of Minecraft servers will continue to face its own iterations of changes, but the main focus was always some type of land-claiming plugin and Movecraft.

The early economy system was nothing more than a few chest shops found in random locations with different buy and sell prices to simulate different regional markets, encouraging players to travel around the map on ‚Äútrade runs‚Äù to earn money. An archaic form of a ‚Äútech tree‚Äù was implemented, using server play time and permissions as a deciding factor in what weapons or equipment a player can access, which as you can imagine became quickly imbalanced.   

AirshipCraft: Reborn (AC:R) is similar to the original AirshipCraft in that it has a heavy focus on Movecraft mechanics. However, that is where the similarities end.   

## Project Overview
> This page will serve as an overview of the entire project. Topics which require more in-depth explanations and plans for their implementation will receive their own section. These sections can be found in the table of contents located on the left-hand side of this page.

### Outline

The purpose of this project is to fulfil the vision of creating a "true" geopolitical experience in Minecraft. Although it is not based on an Earth map, the map is Earth-like enough to encourage the natural growth and creation of nation-states through either player or NPC manipulation. "Dynamic" is the key buzzword for this project.   

The world, much like real-life, should feel fluid (constantly changing). The project will include dynamic market prices as a result of:
- Inflation
- Supply and demand patterns
- Wars and diplomatic actions by foreign nations
- Natural disasters 

All examples listed above are features that this project will attempt to replicate in the virtual world. 

A primary focus of this project is its concentration on NPCs, heavily involving them within embedded game mechanics. This is to keep gameplay constantly engaging for the end user to maximize their gameplay experience.

With NPC-controlled nation-states scattered across the map, there will always be something for the player to do. In theory, the server should be fun and playable even if the player is completely alone on the server.   

The goal of the economy is to be player-driven. There should be enough incentive for players to acquire currency without there being too many obstacles in place which may serve as a  potential deterrent for new players. Finding a good balance is difficult, but not impossible. 

> See [Economy](mech/economy.md)

We want to provide a server where realistic strategy, tactics, and creative thinking will allow players to get ahead. We want players to be able to own and control their own fully functioning and dynamic nations, towns and empires. We seek to find the balance between complexity and simplicity. Allowing for in-depth and complex mechanics but still being extremely player and 'noob friendly', providing a steep enough learning curve to separate the good players from the amateurs in a wider degree of aspects than just raw Minecraft skill. 

Although AirshipCraft was never traditionally marketed as a ‚Äúroleplay‚Äù server (and still technically isn‚Äôt), we are taking steps to emulate a form of ‚Äúroleplay‚Äù environment to immerse players in this new world we are building. This includes the writing of lore, the creation of a quest system, player cards and other things that promote roleplay. Roleplay is highly encouraged but will not be enforced as it should be allowed to occur naturally.

### Game Design

This project is designed with the mindset of building a game. The goal is to design and implement gameplay elements that foster player engagement and boost player retention. Although the server is designed so it can be fun without being populated, it's mutually beneficial for all parties if there is an established player base.   

This graph outlines a player‚Äôs skill vs. difficulty: 

![Skill Vs. Difficulty](images/skill-vs-difficulty.webp)

Note: this shows three difficulty levels and how players react to them based on their skills. Also, note that the blue line enters all three boxes, which is important to get the most players interested in the gameplay.

By itself, this means nothing. However, combine it with this graph:

![Player Interest/Efficacy](images/interest-and-efficacy.jpeg)

This shows that, in the median, player interest is tied to efficacy. In other words, the better you are at something, the more you‚Äôre interested. The interest rate drops according to standard deviations from the median difficulty line as shown in the first graphic. 

The full meaning of both of these graphs isn't realized until we look at this next graph:

![Difficulty and Challenge](images/difficulty-challenge-graph.jpeg)

This graph shows that as you move across difficulty levels, you engage players. This implies you have a game that can watch a player‚Äôs reactions and scale difficulty based on their performance. The AI needs to constantly move between the optimal challenge line, and the blue line in the first graph. It is based on these assumptions:

1. **One cannot design a difficulty that is perfect for everyone.**
2. Therefore, we must move the player above and below the difficulty line using rewards.
3. The best way to do this is to provide multiple reward types that cater to different styles of play.

Rather than categorize players as high-skill vs. low-skill, attenuate the game to make players feel highly skilled and low-skilled. Both levels serve a purpose, as graph 3 shows. Note that the stuff in the quotation marks in graph 3 are the negatives of this mode.

Given this, we think of the following as guiding principles:

- As players move above the optimal challenge line, they feel high satisfaction.
  - Keep them there too long and they quickly devolve into more negative feelings about the play being ‚Äòtoo easy‚Äô or ‚Äòchildish‚Äô.
- As players move below the optimal challenge line, it leads to a high player effort to succeed.
  - Here the positive emotions of challenge and excitement are balanced by the negative pitfalls of it being ‚Äòtoo hard‚Äô or ‚Äòfrustrating‚Äô. You can‚Äôt keep them here too long either.
- The key to successful engagement is to move players across this line using a rewards system that caters to both high satisfaction (ranks, levels, recognition, Right Brain motivators) and high effort (items, upgrades, bonuses, Left Brain motivators).

And finally, again:
- **No two people are the same**, so there is no true ‚Äòoptimal challenge line‚Äô. It is a construct used to understand from measurements when to make hurdles harder or easier based on individual player performance.   

This is one way to deal with player engagement and create addiction. Great games closely adhere to the ‚ÄòOptimal Challenge Line‚Äô as created by each player‚Äôs skill and use the Octalysis drivers to push players back and forth across the line.   

Octalysis is a great breakdown of player motivations by Yu-Kai Chou. We can use the drivers here to motivate high-satisfaction and high-effort players, as each responds differently.    

This is beautifully captured in this graphic:

![Octalysis of Gamification](images/gamification.jpeg)

The graph is a very good guide on what should be kept in mind when proceeding with the development of the server/project. We can, however, for the sake of simplicity, focus mainly on the key points of the graph.

- **Progress**: 
  - As players advance in the game, they should feel a sense of accomplishment. Clear objectives, like levelling up different skills or tech trees, unlocking new items or abilities, or things such as making the world more "exploration worthy" can help achieve this.
- **Feedback**: 
  - Players must receive immediate feedback on their actions, such as points earned or money earned, in order to improve gameplay and keep them engaged.
- **Difficulty**: 
  - The game should be challenging enough to be engaging without being too difficult to the point where players give up in frustration.
- **Social**: 
  - To encourage players to compete with one another, the game should have a social element like leaderboards or some sort of way to give players "bragging rights" but also make those bragging rights worthy of being sought out.

    - An example could possibly be the [cults](mech/cults.md) system, or the [nodes](mech/nodes.md) system.
- **Replayability**: 
  - The game should entice players to return and play it repeatedly. Randomly generated content, an immersive and dynamic world, and other event-like activities and objectives can help accomplish this.

A good storyline can engage players and make them want to keep playing to see what happens next. We aim to accomplish this by providing multiple quest lines that have benefits and impacts on the player who chooses to complete them and possibly (slight) drawbacks to those who don't, in order to gently nudge players to keep playing and trying different things.

### Philosophy
It's important to maintain a commonly shared philosophy when designing or working on mechanics. The general mantra is to add quality of life (QOL) improvements to the player whenever possible. If we are able to streamline the boring, basic, vanilla mechanics and make it very easy, or in some cases automated, for the player, the player can focus on the unique, more interesting and "fun" mechanics we have designed for them.   

If a player sits and has to mine or farm for resources manually for everything they need, then they will only spend about 1/4th or less of their time actually playing the game, since 3/4ths of it would be spent grinding. **Try to limit unnecessary grinds.**   

Designing any sort of progression system or mechanic that requires players to put in the effort is **good** (as we have stated before in the previous section), however, there's a difference between challenging and time-consuming and we want to limit time-consuming whenever possible. 

### Purpose of These Docs
