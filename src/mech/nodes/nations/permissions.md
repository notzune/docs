# Permissions
One of the key features that seperates our nation system from others is the implementation of per-object permissions. This means that town and nation leaders have more freedom assigning permissions to their members outside of simply making someone an officer. It also introduces an "anti-inactiveness" feature where leadership will change hands to the next viable choice in event that the leader of the town or nation were to go inactive for an extended period of time.
